# Abstract

A Haptic feedback glove device that uses a motor camera and mini motor disks to help visually impaired people understand the 3d space around them. A small camera is mounted on the palm of a visually impaired user and is used to construct a depth map used to perform sensory substituition of vision using a high resolution haptic feedback device comprised of an array of mini DC motor discs with intensity analogous to how close an object is. The goal is for the user to be able to do wayfinding and navigate in a room using the device. User studies that examine the usability and quality of the device were done showing that the glove is easy to use, feels intuitive and engaging and is a suitable technique for sensory substitution of vision but was prone to errors, was not efficient and would not be recommended in the current stage to be used as a complete wayfinding solution.
