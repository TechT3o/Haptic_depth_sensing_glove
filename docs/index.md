# Abstract

Haptic feedback glove device that uses a motor camera and mini motor disks to help visually impaired people understand the 3d space around them.

The idea is to mount a small camera on the palm of the visually impaired user, construct the depth map and perform sensory substituition of vision by using a high resolution haptic feedback gloved comprised of an array of mini DC motor disksto assign a different intensity in the direction where the user's hand is pointing at, analogous to how close the object is.

The goal is for the user to be able to identify what type of object their hand is pointing at for object recognition and object fetching and for the user to be able to do wayfinding and navigate in a room using the device. User studies that examine the usability and quality of the device will be done.
