# Project Proposal

## 1. Motivation & Objective

About 284 million people are visually impaired (VI) worldwide and of these, 39 million of them are blind. Common problems that VI people face are the difficulty in navigating / finding their way in the environment, losing objects that are misplaced on surfaces, or identifying and fetching objects around them that are further away from their grasp.

In this project a haptic feedback glove device that uses a motor camera and mini motor disks to help visually impaired people understand the 3D space around them is built. The idea is to mount a small camera on the palm of the visually impaired user, construct the depth map, and perform sensory substitution of vision by using a high-resolution haptic feedback glove comprised of an array of mini DC motor disks to assign a different intensity in the direction where the user's hand is pointing at, analogous to how close the object is.

The goal is for the user to be able to identify what type of object their hand is pointing at for object recognition and object fetching and for the user to be able to do wayfinding and navigate in a room using the device. User studies that examine the usability and effectiveness of the device will be done.

## 2. State of the Art & Its Limitations

There are multiple different approaches that have been performed for sensory substitution of vision to aid VI people in performing multiple different tasks and with multiple different technologies.

The tasks are:
- Navigating a map
- Wayfinding
- Mental mapping
- VR navigating
- Fetching objects
- Driving
- Feeling 2D data

And the technologies used vary and are:
- Vibrotactile on a mobile device
- Smart walker
- Belt
- Smartphone
- Drone
- VR headset
- Camera Bracelet
- Smart Cane
- Tactile wristband
- Sonar array with vibrotactile motors
- Resonating pin array
- Glove with motors
- Audio feedback
- Tablet
- Sleeve
- Smartwatch

The technologies that rely on audio feedback have the limitations of overloading the sensory channel and are slow to transmit environmental information to the user.
Smartphones, tablets, canes, smartwatches, belts, wristbands, and sleeves can transmit a limited amount of information and can't directly provide the 3D space information but require an encoding of this information that is difficult for the user to learn.
Resonating pin arrays and sonar arrays require expensive, bulky, and not portable equipment.

## 3. Novelty & Rationale

Our proposed solution belongs to the family of gloves with motors and aims to tackle the problems of object fetching and wayfinding by allowing for cheap, portable, easy to learn, direct and low-latency feedback of the 3D space without sensory overload.

The resources indicate that:
- Relative depth information can be extracted from a mono camera using neural networks
- Sensory substitution can be performed with vibrotactile motor arrays
- Shapes, faces and objects can be recognized using motor arrays.

Therefore, it should be feasible to combine this research and construct a haptic depth sensing glove that can perform sensory substitution and explore its effectiveness and usability for the tasks of object fetching and wayfinding.


## 4. Potential Impact

### Technical Impact

The technologies developed for this project will have a technical impact since:
- A haptic feedback device will be developed
- The sensitivity and resolution of the human palm to vibrotactile feedback will be investigated
- A real-time mono camera depth estimation system that can be used by embedded devices will be developed

  ### Broad impact

  There are multiple applications for such a device and multiple people can benefit from it.
  
  Visually impaired people will now:
  - have an alternative to navigate in new environments resulting in greater mobility and quality of life.
  - have a way to recognize and fetch objects making them more self-reliant and solving the problem of lost objects.

  Therefore such a device could practically improve the quality of life of the visually impaired community, let them become more self-reliant, more easily navigate to new places, and alleviate pressure from their caregivers.

   With the rise of Virtual Reality headsets and Augmented Reality applications, there is an active research field and a need to develop ubiquitous haptic feedback devices to help a user interact with the virtual world. This glove could be used to address this need and provide haptic feedback such as for button pressing or touching and recognizing virtual objects tasks frequently encountered in Human-Computer Interaction.

## 5. Challenges

- Achieving depth estimation with good enough resolution to understand relative distances between camera objects
- Achieve real-time performance so that there is no latency between where the user is pointing and the perceived haptic feedback
- Achieve good enough haptic resolution with the motor array for the user to recognize different objects and perform wayfinding

## 6. Requirements for Success

- Python skills are required to make a running backend that can collect camera information, find the depth, and determine the mapping and intensities of the motors.
- C++ skills are needed to program the Arduino to communicate with the Python backend, and to control the intensities of each motor.
- Electronic circuit design and soldering skills are required to connect the motors and camera to the microcontroller and to create the motor driver circuit and PCBs.
- 3D printing and design skills are required to print casing for electronic components.
- Hands-on skills are required to put the glove together.

## 7. Metrics of Success

### Quantitative

#### Wayfinding / navigation study
Navigation accuracy - Able to navigate in the room?
Navigation speed - How much time to reach the destination?

#### Object recognition / fetching study
Recognition accuracy - How many objects were detected? 
Recognition speed - How much time to figure out an object?

### Qualitative
- Interview (record answers and do affinity diagram)
- Likert scale questionnaires to figure usability

#### Usability
- Learnability
- Efficiency
- Memorability
- Errors
- Satisfaction

## 8. Execution Plan

### Glove / Haptic side

- Design motor driver circuit.
- Design motor pcb.
- Assemble motor PCBs.
- Check which array configuration is best ( How many motors are in an array, in which places to be placed, what kind of depth to intensity mapping).
- Check if it is possible to understand the type of object using the sensor array. (we can use depth maps from other sources as well for testing this).
- Figure depth resolution ( Can you understand two objects being n meters apart from each other).
(These might all change depending on depth to intensity mapping, the position of motors etc)

### Camera side

- Find which camera to use.
- Find where/ how it is convenient to place the camera.
- Transmit camera data to PC.
- Optimize depth estimation pipeline (model, processing, depth to motor intensity conversion etc) to run in real time. (What is the effect of different estimations per second on perceived accuracy?).

### Combine the two

- 3D print cases / parts for mounting electronic components.
- Assemble the glove.
- Transmit data serially (or wirelessly) between the processing backend and haptic glove.
- Start user testing.

### Extension:

- Make glove wireless.
- Make glove battery-powered.
- Try 3d reconstruction of space and handling VR objects
